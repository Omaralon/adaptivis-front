# What is Adaptivis?
Adaptivis is a web application that allows teachers to create personalized questionnaires using mostly Likert-scale questions. This offers the possibility of creating questionnaires about motivation, personality, type of learning, just to name a few topics of interest.

Students sign up to the platform and participate in the filling of these questionnaires so that teachers can collect information from students and analyze their results within the platform for research purposes.
